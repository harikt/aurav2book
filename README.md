# Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual

*Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual* is a clean and concise guide 
to using the upcoming Aura Framework v2, a powerful and flexible system for web as well as command line applications.

Aura Framework v2 has 3 types of skeletons with which you can start your projects:

1. [aura/web-project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web_Project): For web applications
2. [aura/cli-project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli_Project): For CLI (command line) applications
3. [aura/framework-project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework_Project): For applications with both web and CLI interfaces.

## About the Aura Project

The [Aura Project](http://auraphp.com/about) is a collection of independent PHP
packages, all of which offer features in different categories. Each package is
self-contained and contains only the things it needs for its core functionality.
None of the packages depend on any of the other - you can use each of the
packages on its own. This modularity helps keep projects lean, avoiding bloat.

You can find Aura version 1 packages at [http://auraphp.com/packages/](http://auraphp.com/packages/) or the newer, version 2 packages at over [http://auraphp.com/packages/v2](http://auraphp.com/packages/v2).

## About This Book

This book assumes you have intermediate knowledge of PHP 5. Experiences with other frameworks will be helpful, but isn't necessary.
